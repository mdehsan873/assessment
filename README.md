## Architecture

The application follows a standard Flask structure:

- `app.py`: Main application entry point

- `utils/`: Utility functions for CSV processing and AI integration
- `templates/`: HTML templates
- `static/`: CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets
- `config/`: Configuration settings

## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following tables:

- `csv_data`: Stores information about uploaded CSV files
- `analysis_results`: Stores results of Claude AI analysis
- `system_config`: Stores application configuration
- `telemetry`: Contains system usage data
- `access_logs`: Logs system access
- `external_integrations`: Stores external service connections

<!--
Framework requirements: This application requires Flask 2.0+ and Python 3.8+
